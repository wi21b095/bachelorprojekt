    "content2": "Internationalisationis often abbreviated with the numeronym i18n (in the English word internationalisation there are 18 letters between the first letter I and the last letter n).",
    "content3": "This includes the tasks that the developer/programmer of a programme has to master. For example, they may not hard-code descriptive texts in the source code, but must use variables that are read in from a source at runtime. This also includes date formatting and language-dependent interface design (e.g. text can be of different lengths or the right-to-left orientation can differ)."
